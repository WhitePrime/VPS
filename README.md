### Installation
- Create an account on Heroku
- Click on Deployment Button
- Give a name to your application and click on "Deploy App"
- Sit Back! Relax for 15-20 mins while it sets up
- Go to app_name.herokuapp.com
- Click on "Connect" in top right corner
- BOOM!! Your Free VPS is ready to go!



#### Note 1 : GOLang is pre downloaded and extracted, the path is not set. In order to set it, you need to run the following command: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
#### I have made a script "run-after-go.sh", run this once GO path gets set and all necessary tools made in GOLang will be installed.



### Limitation(s)
- If left untouched for 30-45 minutes, it gets reset. 
- Your work does not get saved, so save it on cloud like GDrive or you can use UptimeRobot(https://uptimerobot.com/) which will ping your website so the website does not get reset in 30 minutes.
- You cannot run as root user since Heroku assigns user id's randomly
